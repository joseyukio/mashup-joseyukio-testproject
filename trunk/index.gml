  <!--
    The Hello World application is a very simple demonstration of how to get
    started in GME. It prints the text "Hello World" to the screen as a level-
    one heading, and shows that standard HTML tags, such as the '<h1>' used
    here, can be used in GME source files (standard JavaScript and CSS can
    also be used).
